# RestAssured BDD Cucumber Framework - Google Maps API
Project Overview
This project demonstrates a RestAssured BDD Cucumber Framework for testing the Google Maps API. It includes automated tests for basic API operations such as GET, POST, and DELETE. The framework is designed with robust features, including HTML report generation, tagging mechanisms for selective test execution, Enum classes for constants, POJO classes, property files for global variables, and comprehensive logging for request and response details.

Features

API Testing: Implemented GET, POST, and DELETE operations for Google Maps API.

BDD with Cucumber: Utilized Gherkin syntax for writing feature files and defining test scenarios.

Tagging Mechanism: Run selected tests using Cucumber tags.

Enum Classes: Managed constant API resources using Enums.

POJO Classes: Created POJOs for request and response data modeling.

Property Files: Centralized global variables for easy configuration.

Logging: Implemented logging to capture request and response details.

HTML Reports: Generated detailed HTML reports for test execution results.
